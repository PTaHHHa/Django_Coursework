# Django_Coursework

Web application for Internet banking. There is a possibility to log in/register. The following functions were implemented:

- creating a client profile
- editing the client's profile
- deleting the client profile
- Deposit of funds
- opening a Deposit
- calculation of Deposit profit at the end of the period

Final mark: 8/10


I'm terribly ashamed of deposit_counter method in views.py
